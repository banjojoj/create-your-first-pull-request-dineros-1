My Expectations:


My expectations for this course is to be proficient in using GIT and GitHub in saving and storing my projects in the cloud. I expect the my professor to teach me a lot of important stuff about using GIT, and I expect my classmates to be good and helpful as well whenever one of us has a problem in programming.
